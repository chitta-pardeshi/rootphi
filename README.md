# rootphi

`rootphi` is a symbolic arithmetic library for representing and manipulating numbers of the form:

$$
\frac{a + b \sqrt{\varphi} + c \varphi + d \varphi \sqrt{\varphi}}{e}
$$

Where $\varphi = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}$ is the **golden ratio**, and $a, b, c, d, e \in \mathbb{Z}$.

## âœ¨ Features

* Exact arithmetic with irrational algebraic numbers ($\varphi$, $\sqrt{\varphi}$)
* Fully symbolic operations: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, power, negation
* String and decimal representations
* Integration with SymPy for symbolic math
* Precision-preserving `.to_decimal_string()` and `.digits()`
* Hashing and equality for use in sets and dicts

## ğŸ“¦ Installation

```bash
pip install rootphi  # (once published)
```

Or clone and use directly:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourname/rootphi.git
cd rootphi
```

## ğŸ§ª Example

```python
from rootphi import rootphi

phi = rootphi.phi()
x = rootphi([1, 0, 1, 0, 1])  # 1 + Ï†

print(x.to_string())  # "(1 + Ï†)"
print((x / phi).to_decimal_string())  # ~1.618...
```
